## Project information  

-   (items describing main strong points)
- Table - a table with four legs and a wood-like texture. A spotlight (the chandelier) is giving a special emphasis on this central piece of the scene.
- Plate - a white plate is standing underneath the cake.
- Cake and cake slice - a beautiful looking carrot cake, with neapolitan icing. A cake slice is dropped on the floor, next to the fallen chair, giving the entire scene a mystery-like feeling. The chandelier spotlight makes this cake the protagonist of the scene.
- Candles - a set of 5 candles are on top of the cake. Each of this candles emits light, making the cake more illuminated.
- Newspaper - created using NURBS, a open newspaper, ready to be read, has its pages widespreaded on top of the table. 
- Spring - using CatmullRomCurves, a big grey spring is displayed.
- Chairs - 6 chairs are sitting around the table. One has fallen to the floor, giving the scene a mystery vibe. Their back, with individual sticks, gives them a more elaborated and real look.
- Window with glass and landscape - a window with a glass-like material, allowing the observation of an amazing landscape - Frecha da Mizarela, Arouca. This view is possible by dividng the wall in four smaller wlasls, creating a hole in the middle. The landscape is displayed in a certain distance from the hole, so that when the observation point changes, a different angle of the picture is viewed. 
- Curtains - another one of the scene's protagonists. Using the GUI slider, they open and close, changing the amount if light that enters the scene through the window.
- Frames - the student's pictures are displayed in two frames. One of them is a little bit tilted, much like as if some action might have happened previously in the scene.
- Beetle - a blue beetle, formed by Bézier curves, is in front of a picture of the 2005 movie "Herbie: Fully Loaded".

- Wall lamps - more spotlights, that can change its colour using the a GUI slider.
- Sofa - a grey sofa, with leather texture, is on a corner of the room.

- Sideboard - supporting a vase with a flower, a red sideboard, matching with the curtains, has an intriguing shape, much like a Chanel symbol. Using NURBS, this interesting little table gives a little bit more life to the scene, while showing the captivating for the eye nature of this kind of curves.
- Vase with flower - a prrety flower, resembling the japonese flag, due to its white petals and red center, was created using circumferences. For the green stalk, a tube geometry was utilized. The vase, created with NURBS, with a clay texture, is holding the flower.
