## Project information  

- Table - a table with four legs and a wood-like texture. The spotlight (the chandelier) is giving a special emphasis on this central piece of the scene.
- Plate - a white plate is standing underneath the cake.
- Cake and cake slice - a beautiful looking carrot cake, with neapolitan icing. A cake slice is dropped on the floor, next to the fallen chair, giving the entire scene a mystery-like feeling. The chandelier spotlight makes this cake the protagonist of the scene.
- Candles - a set of 5 candles are on top of the cake. Each of this candles emits light, making the cake more illuminated.
- Newspaper - created using NURBS, a open newspaper, ready to be read, has its pages widespreaded on top of the table. 
- Spring - created using CatmullRomCurves, a big grey spring is displayed.
- Chairs - 6 chairs are sitting around the table. One has fallen to the floor, giving the scene a mystery vibe. Their back, with individual sticks, gives them a more elaborated and real look.
- Window with glass and landscape - a window with a glass-like material, allowing the observation of an amazing landscape - Frecha da Mizarela, Arouca. This view is possible by dividing the wall in four smaller walls, creating a hole in the middle. The landscape is displayed from a certain distance from the hole, so that when the observation point changes, a different angle of the picture is viewed. 
- Curtains - another one of the scene's protagonists. Using the GUI slider, they open and close, changing the amount of light that enters the scene through the window.
- Frames - the student's pictures are displayed in two frames. One of them is a little bit tilted, much like as if some action might have happened previously in the scene.
- Beetle - a blue beetle, formed by Bézier curves, is in front of a picture of the 2005 movie "Herbie: Fully Loaded".
- Chandelier - the main spotlight, illuminating the cake.
- Wall lamps - more spotlights, that can change its colour using the GUI slider.
- Sofa - a grey sofa, with leather texture, is located on a corner of the room.
- Television - a flat screen is exhibiting a video, using a video texture. The cows appearing in the video belong to one of the students' parents, making the scene feel more homelike.
- Sideboard - supporting a vase with a flower, a red sideboard, matching with the curtains, has an intriguing shape, much like a Chanel symbol. Created using NURBS, this interesting little table gives a little bit more life to the scene, while showing the captivating for the eye nature of this kind of curves.
- Vase with flower - a pretty flower, resembling the japonese flag, due to its white petals and red center, was created using circumferences, one of them with only 5 points, making it a pentagon. For the green stalk, a tube geometry was utilized. The vase, created with NURBS, with a clay texture, is holding the flower.
- Floor and walls - the walls use a diffuse material. The wallpaper was thought to give more life to the scene. The wooden floor appearance can be changed with the sliders present in the GUI.



-   Scene
    -   The scene ![Screenshot](/tp1/screenshots/sceneT05G07.png) consists of a cozy room, filled with mystery. A beautiful landscape can be seen through the window, if the curtains are not covering them. The central piece is a table with a cake full of candles, a spring and a newspaper, all illuminated by a chandelier. A cake slice is next to one of the chairs, both dropped on the floor. In front of them, a flat screen TV shows a video of some cows walking. On the opposite side of the window, there are a sofa and a sidetable, with a glass surface and a vase with a flower on top. Above the sofa, a frame with a beetle is visible. Finally, there are two frames with the students' pictures, one of them slightly tilted. Across the walls, lamps are illuminating even more the scene.

## Issues/Problems

-   All features asked have been implemented.
-   There seemed to be a slight problem with the video. Upon some research, it was discovered that Safari and Google Chrome, unlike Firefox, have some kind of bug that prevents the repetition of videos on Three.js more than one time. So, in those browsers, the video can only be seen the first time.
